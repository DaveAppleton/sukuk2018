* What is a blockchain ?
.background images/Artboard_5.png

- signed transactions
- Put into signed blocks
- Which are added to a chain (list) by signed links
- which is distributed all over a decentralised network (thousands of independent nodes)
- for anybody to see
- in a manner such that all the independant nodes that operate the network agree the whole thing to be valid (consensus)
- in such a way that it is virtually impossible to alter past records

* Authenticity of transactions

A digital signature is a mathematical proof using complex cryptography and can only be generated by somebody holding the private key controlling an account.

A digital signature verifies

- the sender of the transaction
- the contents of the transaction

Private Keys are truly random numbers that can be kept secret using devices like hardware wallets.

* Introduction to Smart Contracts
.background images/Artboard_5.png


- an unalterable program existing on the blockchain
- (preferably) source code available to all (and provable)
- specific permissions may be built into the program
- all transactions are visible and auditable

In other words a program that can allow parties to interact with the full confidence of rules being followed.

Trustlessness : allowing you to interact with other parties without having to trust them

* Introducing HelloGold
.background images/Artboard_5.png


- A Shariah compliant platform allowing people to buy gold for as little as RM1
- Presenting a diversification of savings offerings to those underserved by the banking industry
- Intended to help people weather financial storms like those of 1997

Challenge

- Establishing legitimacy in a field known for "money games"

* HelloGold's use of blockchain

What the blockchain CAN offer

- A shariah compliant platform that allows you to buy and sell gold
- Management fee structure enforced by smart contracts
- Gold can be pledged as collateral against shariah compliant loans with terms enforced by the contracts

What the blockchain CANNOT offer

- proof that the gold exists
- guaranteed good behaviour of the participants (i.e. proof that on chain records reflect off chain reality)

* HelloGold's answer (transparency)

Where the blockchain cannot offer "trustlessness" we have to establish trust.

- Reputable founders / officers
- Work with known and trusted parties (UOB FinLab, AEON Credit, Axiata, auditors, independant vaults) who can be trusted to have performed due diligence
- Provide as much third party verification as possible (e.g. audits, bar list by vaulting agent, public list of gold holding by account) without infringing individual privacy
- We are looking at extending this to keeping copies of certain documents in distributed storage

* Extending this to the sukuk markets

Blockchain helps with...

- Shariah compliance establishes fairness by specifying certain rules. Some of these can be encoded on a smart contract enabled blockchain.
- Blockchain transactions are usually fully transparent, this give an ability to "trust" part of the operations.
- Blockchain transactions are immutable - so the records cannot be altered to conveniently rewrite history
- The more parties interacting improves the legitimacy of the system

But needs to be complimented by

- maximising trust where the blockchain may cannot provide the solution

caveat : I am coming at this as a technical person
